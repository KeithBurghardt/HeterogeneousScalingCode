# HeterogeneousScalingSimulations
Simulated institution growth and scaling created for paper entitled, "The Emergence of Heterogeneous Scaling in Research Institutions" by Keith Burghardt, Zihao He, Allon Percus, and Kristina Lerman

Requires Python 3.X, Numpy, and Pandas

Output of data:
- Sequence researchers appear (simulation_sequence.pkl)
- Parameters of model (Parameters.csv)
- Cross-sectional collaboration scaling exponents over time (CrossInstitutionScaling.csv)
- Institution statistics: number of researchers,	internal collaborators, and	external collaborators over time, as well as institution-specific densification parameter, p.	Optionally, the external scaling parameter, q, could differ from the internal scaling parameter. In the paper, both values are the same.
